My month-long internship at Encryptix was a transformative experience where I dove deep into web development, honing my skillsin HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT. From Building a calculator to creating a landing page and finally developing my own portfolio, each project pished me to grow and refine my craft. I'm excited to carry these experiences forward as I continue to develop as a web developer!
